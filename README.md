BitCrack: Bitcoin Key Finder Tool

BitCrack is a computer program that we create to try to find a private key if we only know the Bitcoin address. It's like trying to find the right key to open a particular mailbox.

This program supports several types of Bitcoin addresses (and others that I didn't upload):

P2PKH addresses
P2SH addresses
Bech32 addresses
And addresses in "hex" format

How Does It Work?

The program will generate a random private key
From this private key, the program calculates the corresponding Bitcoin address
The program then compares this address with the target address
If it matches, then we have found the correct private key!

This program uses the formula:

Elliptic Curve paired with Hash Function and moves in Multi-thread

Special Features for Hex Address

Can recognize hex addresses directly
Can match addresses only
Calculate the percentage of matches to know how close
Try various variations and hash manipulations

Finding this private key is very difficult because:

The number of possible keys is very large (like looking for 1 grain of sand on all the beaches on earth)
The mathematical calculation of the elliptic curve takes a long time with a lot of power, There is no shortcut, we have to try one by one. therefore it takes a capable CPU and GPU when working.
